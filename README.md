# rdr2-2023-site-clone
Well, basically I decide to at least try to use WayBack Machine [Way Back Machine](web.archive.org) to recreate the Red Dead Redemption 2 website in 2023 (currently it is ugly compared to 2023). Why? Because I liked him.

I know, it's a mess but I'm going to try to fix it little by little.

# Notes
- Remember, I used web.archive.org to get all the files and codes. More specificlly, in ```https://web.archive.org/web/20230815011942cs_/https://www.rockstargames.com/reddeadredemption2``` at the most.

- No, the [main html code](./index.html) is not the original, I had to change some things, remove some and add [important javascript](./assets/js/script.js)

- What remains to be done
  - Download more images that are in the [main css](./assets/css/2455f5211be05b218519.css)
  - Somehow obtain the code from the sites https://www.rockstargames.com/reddeadredemption2/features/weaponry, https://www.rockstargames.com/reddeadredemption2/features/wildlife and so on in [Way Back Machine](web.archive.org), so far, only definitive There's https://www.rockstargames.com/reddeadredemption2
